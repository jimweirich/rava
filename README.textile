h1. Rava -- Ruby for Java Programmers

Switching from Java to Ruby can be a big change for programmers.  The
Rava library is designed to make that transition easier.

h2. Installation

Install via gems:

  sudo gem install jimweirich-rava

h2. Usage

  require 'rava'

h3. Easy Console I/O

Who can remember *puts* vs. *print* and all the other subtle
differences in Ruby I/O functions.  Real programmers aren't afraid of
a little extra typing to get reliable I/O.

In Rava, you can do:

  System.out.println("A Message")

  System.err.println("An Error Message")

h3. Creating new objects

Java programmers have a hard time remember that the new method is a
class method on an object class.  Inteady writing:

   SomeThing.new

Java programmers would much rather use:

   new SomeThing

h3. Using Java CamelCase on Ruby methods

Java programmers are use to using camelcase for all method names.
This underscore business is so baroque.  Rava allows you to call
methods using camel case.

In other words, you can do this:

   obj.someMethod

rather than:

   obj.some_method
